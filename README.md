# üõ©Ô∏è "UAV is online"

IMechE UAS Challenge at the University of Leicester. This repo is my public record as CFD lead for our water delivery mission UAV. No secret sauce here. Just what I tried, what worked, and what I parked for later.

This is not the team tutorial. That lives in a private PDF for the squad. Here I am documenting my own work so future me does not need a Red Bull to remember what happened.

The aim is simple. Build one baseline that runs on a normal laptop. Make small changes that are easy to compare. Keep plots clean with axes, units, and a caption that actually says something.

I am using SimScale for easy access and because its beginner-friendly for myself and the team. Star-CCM might be used when I can get a seat. SolidWorks for tidy geometry edits. Light Python or MATLAB for quick plots if needed. Results are trimmed screenshots and short notes only!

If something looks wrong, I will say so and fix it on the next pass.

Reach out to me if you have any feedback or advice!
