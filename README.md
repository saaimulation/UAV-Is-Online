# üõ©Ô∏è "UAV is online"

IMechE UAS Challenge at the University of Leicester. This repo is my public record as CFD lead for our water delivery mission UAV. No secret sauce here. Just what I tried, what worked, and what I parked for later.

This is not the team tutorial. That lives in a private PDF for the squad. Here I am documenting my own work so future me does not need a Red Bull to remember what happened.

The aim is simple. Build one baseline that runs on a normal laptop. Make small changes that are easy to compare. Keep plots clean with axes, units, and a caption that actually says something.

I am using SimScale for easy access and because its beginner-friendly for myself and the team. Star-CCM might be used when I can get a seat. SolidWorks for tidy geometry edits. Light Python or MATLAB for quick plots if needed. Results are trimmed screenshots and short notes only!

If something looks wrong, I will say so and fix it on the next pass.

Reach out to me if you have any feedback or advice!

# üìì personal logbook

this is my own running record for the uol aerolabs uav project. I lead cfd and I am using this space to track what I tried, why I changed things, and what I learned.

this is not the team tutorial. designs and results are shared here with the team‚Äôs ok. no raw cad or giant solver files. screenshots and short notes only.

how I write entries
short notes only
one idea per entry
plain language so future me can follow without detective work

naming
use dates like 2025 10 09 and simple ids like baseline 02 or flap plus2deg
save images as 2025 10 09_baseline 02_pressure.png with a short caption

credit
this log reflects my work and decisions as cfd lead
design and testing are a team effort and I will credit teammates by name in weekly summaries when they want to be named
