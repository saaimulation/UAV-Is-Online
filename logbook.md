# 📓 Personal Logbook
This is my own running record for the UoL Aerolabs UAV project. I lead cfd and I am using this space to track what I tried, why I changed things, and what I learned.  

This is not the team tutorial. Designs and results are shared here with the team principles permission.   

No raw cad or giant solver files. Screenshots and short notes only.

### ✉️ Template
How I write entries: short notes only, one idea per entry, plain language so future me can follow without detective work! 

date:  
run id:  
question:  
what changed:  
why:  
what I looked at:   
next:  

### 💳 Credit 
This log reflects my work and decisions as cfd lead. Design and testing are a team effort and I will credit teammates by name in weekly summaries when they want to be named :)
